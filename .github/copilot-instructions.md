## Specific Instructions for Copilot

### Code Generation
- **Java 21 Features:** Utilize modern Java 21 features where appropriate (e.g., records, pattern matching for switch, virtual threads if applicable).
- **Spring Boot Conventions:** Follow standard Spring Boot conventions for configuration, dependency injection, and component scanning within the infrastructure layer.

## Tone and Style
- **Formal and Informative:** Maintain a professional and informative tone.
- **Concise:** Provide clear and direct answers or suggestions.
